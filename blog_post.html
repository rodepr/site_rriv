        <b>Why did we do this?</b><br>
        Up to this point, the team had been thinking in the constraints of the robust version of our software product with 3 major risky dependencies. We had just made this monumental decision to release a thinner slice of the app without these integrations, but how were we going to start thinking beyond the constraints of today? "What would X do?", or WWxD, helped us achieve that by enabling us to think outside of our own personalities. In this case, "X" is a persona to mimic design thinking. <br><br>

        <b>What did we do? </b><br>

        Everyone generated 2 "X" identities: i.e. a celebrity or company to embody while they were solving the prompt "Reduce the time for our user persona to create an output". Everyone randomly pulled 2 "X" identities from a hat, and had to channel this person or company throughout the two rounds of the design exercise. We shared our ideas with the team, and generated a lot of laughs, from Indiana Jones and the lost "Arc" (the name of our product), to Bill Murray, who simply wanted to flick collection requirement (premise of the application's function) because that would be a funny way to do it, to Delta Airlines, that guided our user persona through the creation process step-by-step.<br><br>

        <b>What did we learn?</b><br>

        Not only did we have a lot of fun doing this exercise, it was also valuable to personify these X identities to remove our personal biases, especially because the team had been working on a more complex solution. When we took away the X identities in our later design divergence and convergence exercises, we observed that some of the solutions were actually very viable.
