        <b>Why did we do this?</b><br>
        Due to the team revisiting of the short term project focus, which seeks to not be dependent on external services, the team wanted to make sure our technical decisions supported the project direction. The team's goal was to ensure our technology choices would not be limiting our future development while leveraging them to their maximum potential. <br><br>

        <b>What did we do? </b><br>

        The balanced team discussed the possible decisions we might need to make in the short, medium, and long-term to determine the level of impact that choices might make on our ability to deliver functionality. When possible, the team opted to postpone making a decision if we agreed that it would not impact our ability to deliver in the future. If it was not possible to defer the decision, the team looked to make choices that were the simplest for the short term, but to be mindful of design patterns that would allow a more complex or complete solution in the future if needed.

        Finally, the team took a confidence vote (1 being the lowest, 3 the highest) on how well Node and Java could meet the needs of our application. <br><br>

        <b>What did we learn?</b><br>

        The intent of the exercise was to focus on the value proposition of each technology for our application rather than making an either-or decision.  We compared the final scores given to each core technology and determined that moving forward with a REST-ful backend using NodeJS is the best fit. Additionally, agreement was reached that several of the technology decisions can safely be deferred to a later time.
