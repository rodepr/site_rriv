  <div class = title>Divergence & Convergence</div><i>(An ideation exercise)</i>
<p><em>Author: Roger Reyes & Susie Forbath, <br>8 Nov 2018</p></em>

  <b>Why did we do this?</b><br>
  Following a major "Type1" decision to build our leaner application with less dependencies, we had several design ideas extracted from the "WWxD" exercise.  Our design led a divergence and convergence exercise to better synthesis those ideas into a design path forward. <br><br>

  <b>What did we do? </b><br>

  The design team brought all of the previous drawn ideas and we cut them into smaller squares, then we spread them out on the table. We actively found similarities in design, such as Wizard formats, Card templates, Checklist procedures, Trello-esque, etc.  Then we dot votes on the designs that made the most sense for what our user was trying to accomplish.  We prominently voted on the Card templates, so we diverged again into a Crazy 4s to come up with a Card-themed design.  After getting our new design ideas focused on Cards, we cut those into squares and grouped the similar design ideas again.   We named those grouping based on the UI interaction, (i.e Brita group [filtering cards], Percolator group [input data, sifting the desire data to an output], etc).  Then dot voted again and the Percolator group of design ideas won our interest.<br><br>

  <b>What did we learn?</b><br>

  We decided to build a design solution around the "Percolator concept" of taking various inputs of data required for planning, then sifting through that data to output the desired plan that our users are interested in creating for their mission.
